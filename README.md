## About the project
1. Created an escrow smart contract which supports RBAC (Role Based Access Control).
2. Buyer can select an agent to be the middleman.
3. Buyer transfers the fund to the agent.
4. Seller then transfers the product/service (depends on the agreement between buyer/seller) to the buyer.
5. Buyer confirms the delivery.
6. Agent validates the transaction.
7. If condition is met, seller receives the fund and agent gets 10% commission.
8. If condition is not met (product/service was not delivered), agent reverts the fund back to buyer.
